This board is based on the **STM32F411** MCU. It is split into two sections: the **ST-LINK Programmer** and the **MCU board** itself. The programmer features a Mini-USB connector for PC connectivity; however, this USB connection is not shared with the MCU.

* **MCU:** STM32F411
* **Logic Level:** 3.3V

## Jumpers

The board features a variety of solder bridges (jumpers) on the bottom side. Each has a specific function; some are used to configure the board for different MCUs, and an incorrect selection could potentially damage the hardware.

For this project, the focus was on:

* **SB17:** Connects **PC13** to the User Button. This was disconnected to prevent interference with the project.
* **SB21:** Connects the User LED to **PA5 (D13)**.
* **SB79 & SB48:** These disconnect **PC14** and **PC15** from the external headers. These two pins are typically used for the (currently unpopulated) **X3** crystal oscillator.

For a full list of functions, refer to the [Schematic](./images/mb1136-default-c03_schematic.pdf).
